# Tabs Manager

This extension organizes your Chrome extension and Chrome Web store documentation tabs.

It shows an example of doing the following:

   - Create an extension popup using the Action API.
   - Query for specific tabs using the Tabs API.
   - Preserve user privacy through narrow host permissions.
   - Change the focus of the tab.
   - Move tabs to the same window and group them.
   - Rename tab groups using the TabGroups API.

## Test that it works

   - Load your extension locally
   - Open a few documentation pages
